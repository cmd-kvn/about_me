      <p>Hello. I can only tell you about myself in brief. Consul Han needs my attention in solving a kidnapping case.
         His daughter has been kidnapped by Juntao. Poor Soo-Yung!
         <br /><br />
         I spend my time in a few different locations:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Hong Kong, China, where I'm originally form.
        </li>
        <li>Los Angeles, USA, where I am currently.
        </li>
        <li>New York, USA, when I want to see the Knicks play.
        </li>
        <li>Paris, France, for family reunions.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
         I'd be farther along in my investigation
         if I was working alone. Instead I'm working with this character from LAPD. He doesn't like the Beach Boys for some reason.
         I think they're great American Music.
         <br /> <br />
         Our trail so far has taken us to:
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>A pool hall.
        </li>
        <li>The Chinese Consulate.
        </li>
        <li>An abandoned warehouse.
        </li>
        <li>Chinatown for some eel and camel hump.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <p>Who knows, maybe this East meets West experience will work out after we upstage the FBI, shake down a pool hall, and get funky
         to some <em>War</em>. Perhaps a sequel or two will come out after this...
