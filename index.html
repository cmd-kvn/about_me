      <p>Hello. I can only tell you about myself in brief. Consul Han needs my attention in solving a kidnapping case.
         His daughter has been kidnapped by Juntao. Poor Soo-Yung!
      </p>

      <p>Originally I'm from Hong Kong, China but currently I'm in Los Angeles on my mission. I'd be farther along in my search
         if I was working alone. Instead I'm working with this character from LAPD. He doesn't like the Beach Boys for some reason.
         I think they're great American Music.
      </p>

      <p>Who knows, maybe this East meets West experience will work out after we upstage the FBI, shake down a pool hall, and get funky
         to some <em>War</em>. Perhaps a sequel or two will come out after this...
