// Description: Design a guessing game about you that involves FIVE yes/no questions. Be creative and fun and whimsical. Or not.

and accommodate users entering all-caps Y/N or YES/NO answers, too.*/

/* Useful and descriptive console.log() messages in the JS are well written
and correctly displaying to the browser console for each question of the guessing game.*/
